# LinuxToolKit-Automated Script

I'm just using this script to autmatically:

- Update Ubuntu/Debian base
- Do an Ubuntu release upgrade
- Install AMP Server Interface
- Install common tools that I need, like OpenJDK, btop, hd-idle, etc...
- and more comming.

If you want to use this script, make sure that it runs as root (sudo su -)
