# LinuxToolKit-Automated Script

I'm just using this script for my GNU/Linux Server to automatically:

- Update Ubuntu/Debian base
- Do an Ubuntu release upgrade
- Install AMP Server Interface
- Install common tools that I need, like OpenJDK, btop, screen, etc...
- and more comming.

If you want to use this script, make sure that it runs as sudo


Dependencies:
- G++ compiler
- make
- GNU/Linux (Debian based distro prefered for some stuff working as expected)
